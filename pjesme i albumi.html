        <p class="lyrics">Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump<p>
            <p class="lyrics">Tell me that you love me when you know you don't love<br>
But I guess I guess I guess is all good<br>
You can play the game, I'mma still do my thang<br>
Ain't no better way for it to be put<br>
When you fuck them other girls I bet they be wondering why you always call my name<br>
You think I'm gonna wait around<br>
I ain't got all day<p>
    <p class="lyrics">You don't need another lover<br>
Don't you let it go<br>
I already got it covered, let the others know<p>
    <p class="lyrics">If you want it let's do it<br>
Ride it, my pony, my saddle<br>
Is waitin', come and, jump on it<br>
If you want it let's do it<br>
Ride it, my pony, my saddle<br>
Is waitin', come and, jump on it<p>
    <p class="lyrics">Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump<p>
        <p class="lyrics">Think I give a damn boy don't you know who I am<br>
I ain't runnin' 'round kissing no dude<br>
Think somebody else like me gon' come around<br>
Boy you got it misunderstood<br>
Put it in your face but you wreckin' us yet<br>
Like you can't recognize a good thing<p>
    <p class="lyrics">Now that you got a chance<br>
Tell me what it's gon' be?<p>
    <p class="lyrics">You don't need another lover<br>
Don't you let it go<br>
I already got it covered, let the others know<p>
    <p class="lyrics">If you want it let's do it<br>
Ride it, my pony, my saddle<br>
Is waitin', come and, jump on it<br>
If you want it let's do it<br>
Ride it, my pony, my saddle<br>
Is waitin', come and, jump on it<p>
    <p class="lyrics">Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump<p>
        <p class="lyrics">You say it's my fault, OK I get it<br>
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it<br>
See you put up your wall<br>
You know you did it, the rise and the fall, just admit it<br>
You say it's my fault, okay I get it<br>
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it<br>
It's the the rise and the fall<br>
It's the the rise and the fall<br>
And you could have had it all<p>
    <p class="lyrics">If you want it let's do it<br>
Ride it, my pony, my saddle<br>
Is waitin', come and, jump on it<br>
If you want it let's do it<br>
Ride it, my pony, my saddle<br>
Is waitin', come and, jump on it<p>
    <p class="lyrics">Jump, jump, jump on it<br>
Jump, jump, jump on it<br>
Jump, jump, jump on it<br>
Jump on it, jump on it<br>
Jump, jump, jump on it<br>
Jump, jump, jump on it<br>
Jump, jump, jump on it<br>
Jump on it, jump on it<p>
